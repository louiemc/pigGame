## A game where you dare to roll the dice for a higher score...OR BUST

Almost like Black Jack, but with a goal of 100+

## How to play?

The active player will click 'Roll Dice' and the dice number will be added to their current score.

Keep clicking 'Roll Dice' if you dare because if a '1' is rolled then the active player will lose their current score and their turn will be over!

If you want to keep the current score, all you need to do is click the 'Hold' button, which will hold the amount you rolled and add it to be your total score.

The first player to reach a score of 100+ will be the winner!

& if you want to play a new game, go ahead and click 'New Game.'
